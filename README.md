# BLS_Dashboard
This notebook pulls data from BLS using their API and visualises it after some simple data manipulation, calculations are as such to match those posted on BBG and other news sources.

In order to make use of it, ensure you have a BLS API Key, which can be obtained from their website. Either paste on the notebook as BLS_API_KEY variable or store in separate .env file.
